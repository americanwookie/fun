Scott's random, trying new things repo. Think of it as my laboratory, with me as the mad scientist. These are unfinished scripts that I may have, in part, used in various places. In an ideal world, they'll get spun off into their own projects.

Muahahahahah

Current Experiments
-------------------

* __IPTables::libiptc__ exploration (in ./libiptc)
* __Parsing Apache Logs__ My original parsing technique for Apache log files. Ideally I'll start a new project and make this better
